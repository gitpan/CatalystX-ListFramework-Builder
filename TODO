NOT FIXABLE?
 - "tablename as checkboxname is bad, cause i have 'view' classes which have an
   sql statement as table" (abraxxa)
     - DBIx::Class can't detect a View in the DB, so this can't be done
       automatially - perhaps a config setting in the Result Class?
 - "why do you name the columns col[n] in the search but use the column names
   to access the data in Controller::AJAX sub list" addl sql query (abraxxa)
     - Genuine confusion about this one - we're not setting "col" anywhere.
