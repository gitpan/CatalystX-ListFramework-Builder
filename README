NAME
    CatalystX::ListFramework::Builder - Instant AJAX web front-end for
    DBIx::Class, using Catalyst

VERSION
    This document refers to version 0.28 of
    CatalystX::ListFramework::Builder

WARNING
    This is an *ALPHA RELEASE*. I'd really appreciate any bug reports; you
    can use the CPAN RT bug tracking system, or email me (Oliver) directly
    at the address at the bottom of this page. Please also be aware that the
    configuration file content has changed from previous releases of the
    module.

PURPOSE
    You have a database schema available through DBIx::Class, and wish to
    have a basic web interface supporting Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete
    and Search, with little effort.

    This module, with only a few lines of configuration, is able to create
    such interfaces on the fly. They are a bit whizzy and all Web 2.0-ish.

SYNOPSIS
    A configuration file somewhere on your system:

     # [listframeworkuser.conf] in Config::General format
 
     extjs2   /javascript/extjs-2
 
     <Model::LFB::DBIC>
         schema_class   My::Database::Schema
         connect_info   dbi:Pg:dbname=mydbname;host=mydbhost.example.com;
         connect_info   username
         connect_info   password
         <connect_info>
             AutoCommit   1
         </connect_info>
     </Model::LFB::DBIC>

    And in the CGI area of your web server:

     package ListFrameworkUser;
     use Catalyst qw(ConfigLoader +CatalystX::ListFramework::Builder);
 
     __PACKAGE__->setup;
     1;

    Now going to the CGI area's URL will display a list of the tables in
    your database. Each item is a link to the web interface for that table.

DESCRIPTION
    This module contains an application which will automatically construct a
    web interface for a database on the fly. The web interface supports
    Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete and Search operations.

    The interface is not written to static files on your system, and uses
    AJAX to act upon the database without reloading your web page (much like
    other Web 2.0 appliactions, for example Google Mail).

    The goals of the system are to require as little repetition of effort on
    your part as possible - the DRY principle (Don't Repeat Yourself).
    Almost all the information required is retrieved from the DBIx::Class
    ORM frontend to your database, which it is expected that you have
    already set up (although see "USAGE", below). This means that any change
    in database schema ought to be reflected immediately in the web
    interface after a page refresh.

USAGE
  "DBIx::Class" setup
    You will need "DBIx::Class" schema to be created and installed on your
    system. The recommended way to do this quickly is to use the excellent
    DBIx::Class::Schema::Loader module which connects to your database and
    writes "DBIx::Class" Perl modules for it.

    Pick a suitable namespace for your schema, which is not related to this
    application. For example "DBIC::Database::Foo::Schema" for the "Foo"
    database. Then use the following command-line incantation:

     perl -MDBIx::Class::Schema::Loader=make_schema_at,dump_to_dir:. -e \
         'make_schema_at("DBIC::Database::Foo::Schema", { relationships => 1 }, \
         ["dbi:Pg:dbname=foodb;host=mydbhost.example.com","user","pass" ])'

    This will create a directory (such as "DBIC") which you need to move
    into your Perl Include path.

  "DBIx::Class" helpers
    When the web interface wants to display a column which references
    another table, you can make things look much better by adding a custom
    render method to your "DBIx::Class" Result Classes (i.e. the class files
    for each table).

    First, the application will look for a method called "display_name" and
    use that. Here is an example which could be added to your Result Class
    files below the line which reads "DO NOT MODIFY THIS OR ANYTHING ABOVE",
    and in this case returns the data from the "title" column:

     sub display_name {
         my $self = shift;
         return $self->title || '';
     }

    Failing the existence of a "display_name" method, the application
    attempts to stringify the row object. Using stringification is not
    recommended, although some people like it. Here is an example of a
    stringification handler:

     use overload '""' => sub {
         my $self = shift;
         return $self->title || '';
     }, fallback => 1;

    If all else fails the application prints the best hint it can to
    describe the foreign row. This is something approximating the name of
    the foreign table, the names of the primary keys, and associated values.
    It's better than stringifying the object the way Perl does, anyway.

    One other very important tip: for those columns where your database uses
    an auto-incremented value, add the "is_auto_increment => 1," option to
    the relevant hash in add_columns(). This will let the application know
    you don't need to supply a value for new or updated records. The
    interface will look much better as a result.

    Finally, buried within one of the modules in this application are some
    filters, which are applied to data of certain types as it enters or
    leaves the database. If you find a particular data type is not being
    rendered correctly, please drop the author a line at the email address
    below, explaining what you'd like to see instead.

  Download and install ExtJS
    You'll need to download the ExtJS Javascript Library (version 2.2+
    recommended), from this web page:
    <http://extjs.com/products/extjs/download.php>.

    Install it to your web server in a location that it is able to serve as
    static content. Make a note of the path used in a URL to retrieve this
    content, as it will be needed in the application configuration file,
    below.

  Application configuration file
    Create the application configuration file, an example of which is below:

     extjs2   /javascript/extjs-2
     <Model::LFB::DBIC>
         schema_class   My::Database::Schema
         connect_info   dbi:Pg:dbname=mydbname;host=mydbhost.example.com;
         connect_info   username
         connect_info   password
         <connect_info>
             AutoCommit   1
         </connect_info>
     </Model::LFB::DBIC>

    The "Model::LFB::DBIC" section must look (and be named) exactly like
    that above, except you should of course change the "schema_class" value
    and the values within "connect_info".

    The application needs to know where your copy of ExtJS is, on the web
    server. Use the "extjs2" option as shown above to specify the URL path
    to the libraries. This will be used in the templates in some way like
    this:

     <script type="text/javascript" src="[% c.extjs2 %]/ext-all.js" />

   Relocating LFB to another URL path
    If you want to use this application as a plugin with another Catalyst
    system, it should work fine, but you probably want to serve pages under
    a different path on your web site. To do that, add the following to your
    configuration file:

     <Controller::LFB::Root>
         <action>
             <base>
                 PathPart   admin
             </base>
         </action>
     </Controller::LFB::Root>

    In the above example, the path ".../admin/" will contain the LFB
    application, and all generated links in LFB will also make use of that
    path. Remember this is added to the "base" of your Cataylst application
    which, depending on your web server configuration, might also have a
    leading path.

  Catalyst application
    The final step is to write a very small file which allows this module to
    bootstrap a Catalyst application around your database. Locate on your
    web server the area where Perl content is executed, and create a file as
    below:

     package ListFrameworkUser;
     use Catalyst qw(ConfigLoader +CatalystX::ListFramework::Builder);
 
     __PACKAGE__->setup;
     1;

    Let your web server know that this file is to be executed for any
    request which comes to its location.

    If necessary, you'll need to let the "ConfigLoader" plugin know of the
    whereabouts of your application configuration file. See the
    Catalyst::Plugin::ConfigLoader documentation for more details, although
    here is a brief example of the change required:

     __PACKAGE__->config( 'Plugin::ConfigLoader' => { file => 'myapp.conf' } );
     __PACKAGE__->setup;

  Accessing the application from your browser
    Presumably the location of the Catalyst application created in the
    previous section maps to a particular URL path. Follow this path with
    the name of a table in the database, and you should be presented with a
    table of data. If you omit the table name, then the application prompts
    you with a list of the available tables.

EXAMPLES
    There is an "examples" directory included with this distribution which
    includes the files necessary to set up a small demo application with
    SQLite3.

LIMITATIONS
    Single column primary key
        There's no support for multiple column primary keys
        (composite/compound keys). This has saved a lot of time in
        development because it greatly simplifies the Catalyst and
        DBIx::Class code.

    No two columns in a given table may have the same FK constraint
        If you have two columns which both have foreign key constraints to
        the same table, it's very likely LFB will not work. Again this is a
        simplification which speeded the initial development.

    For the issues above, if you're desperate that the feature be
    implemented soon, please drop me a line at the address below, because
    you might be able to buy some of my time for the development.

REQUIREMENTS
    *   ExtJS Javascript Library (version 2.2+ recommended), from
        <http://extjs.com>.

    *   Catalyst::Runtime >= 5.70

    *   Catalyst::Model::DBIC::Schema

    *   Catalyst::View::JSON

    *   Catalyst::View::TT

    *   Catalyst::Action::RenderView

    *   Class::C3

SEE ALSO
    CatalystX::ListFramework is similar but has no dependency on Javascript
    (though it can use it for fancy auto-complete searches), and it also
    allows you to control which columns are rendered in the display.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
    Without the initial work on "CatalystX::ListFramework" by Andrew Payne
    and Peter Edwards this package would not exist. If you are looking for
    something like this module but without the dependency on Javascript,
    please do check out CatalystX::ListFramework.
